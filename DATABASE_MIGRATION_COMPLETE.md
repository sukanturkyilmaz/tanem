## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Data Loss:
**THIS MIGRATION WILL DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA!**

The SQL script starts with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ... CASCADE`

**Before running:**
- Backup important data if needed
- Confirm you're on correct Supabase project
- Read the instructions carefully

### Environment Variables:
**Your .env file has been updated!**

Old values were for project: `rtswtjgblxhyvlmaspmp`
New values are for project: `ocmofokkokzufivkcafr`

**If you need old project back:**
You'll need to manually revert .env changes

### Production Deployment:
**Don't deploy before testing locally!**

Steps must be done in order:
1. Run migration in Supabase ✅
2. Test locally ✅
3. Update Vercel env vars ✅
4. Then deploy ✅

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Migration Fails:
- Check Supabase logs tab
- Look for specific error message
- Re-run COMPLETE_MIGRATION.sql (it's idempotent)

### Can't Login Locally:
- Verify admin profile exists
- Check auth user in Supabase Auth dashboard
- Verify .env file is correct
- Restart dev server

### Production Not Working:
- Check Vercel environment variables
- Verify deployment succeeded
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Vercel logs

### Still Stuck:
1. Read `SUPABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` troubleshooting section
2. Check all verification queries in `QUICK_START_SQL.sql`
3. Verify build succeeded: `npm run build`

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Optimizations Included:
- ✅ Indexes on all foreign keys
- ✅ Indexes on frequently queried fields

- ✅ Trigger functions for notifications

### Expected Query Performance:
- Policies list: < 50ms
- Claims list: < 50ms
- Client list: < 50ms
- Dashboard stats: < 100ms
- PDF upload: 1-3 seconds (depending on file size)
