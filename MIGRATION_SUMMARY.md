### 3. Code Updates

#### `.env` File
**Before:**
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://rtswtjgblxhyvlmaspmp.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi... (old key)
```

**After:**
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ocmofokkokzufivkcafr.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi... (correct key)
```

#### `src/lib/supabase.ts`
**Before:**

## 🚨 Important Notes

### CRITICAL: Manual Steps Required

**This migration CANNOT be run automatically because:**
1. Requires Supabase SQL Editor access
2. Will DROP all existing tables (destructive operation)
3. Needs manual verification at each step
4. Must confirm admin user creation
5. Should verify bucket creation

**DO NOT skip the manual steps!**

### Data Loss Warning

**⚠️ THIS MIGRATION WILL DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA!**

The script starts with:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ... CASCADE;
```

This is INTENTIONAL for a clean installation.

**Before running:**
- Backup any important data
- Export existing records if needed
- Verify you're on the correct Supabase project

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After running the migration, you should have:

1. ✅ 13 tables in public schema
2. ✅ 5 storage buckets configured
3. ✅ 19 insurance companies loaded
4. ✅ Admin profile created
5. ✅ Default settings inserted
6. ✅ All RLS policies active
7. ✅ All triggers functioning
8. ✅ All indexes created

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected Count:** 13 tables

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

**If something goes wrong:**

1. The migration script is idempotent
2. You can re-run it multiple times
3. DROP CASCADE ensures clean slate each time
4. No partial states possible

**To rollback:**
Just re-run the COMPLETE_MIGRATION.sql script again.
